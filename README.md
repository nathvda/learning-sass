# learning-sass

Welcome to my repository ! 

I've been working on this repository since November 18th 2022, and I will be working on it for a few days. 

The goal of this repository is for me to learn Sass as a junior web developper, to grasp the whole extent of its possibilities. Thank you for visiting this repository.
